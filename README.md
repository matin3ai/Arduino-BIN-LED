##ðŸš€ How to Run
        1.	Hardware Setup:
	2â€¢	Connect each LED to one of the pins defined in the LEDpin array through a 220-ohm resistor.
	2â€¢	Connect the other end of the resistors to Arduino digital pins and the LED cathodes to GND.
	3.	Upload the Code:
	4â€¢	Open the code in Arduino IDE.
	5â€¢	Select the appropriate board and port.
	6â€¢	Upload the code to the board.
  	7.	Test Functionality:
	8â€¢	Open the serial monitor at a baud rate of 115200.
	9â€¢	Send a number between 0 and 255.
	10â€¢	Each bit of the sent number will control the state of a corresponding LED (ON/OFF).
